# Tailored Health Services

This version of Tailored Health Services is a simple demo using only HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Tailored Health Services is a platform to connect clients who want to improve their health and fitness with providers such as doctors, trainers, and therapists. The providers work together to create a tailored experience unique to the clients personal fitness goals.   

In this demo, I have implemented a visual slideshow and simply layout to summarize the purpose of the web application. 

Simply clicking login will direct you to the doctors page. In this page, I implemeted a filter to select patients, therapist, or fitness trainers. Depending on who you select you are able to view their notes and can also add notes.
